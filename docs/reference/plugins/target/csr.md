# CSR
Use a certificate signing request generated by third party software. 
When this target plugin is chosen, you will obviously not be able to select 
a [CSR plugin](/win-acme/reference/plugins/csr/) as well, meaning that any
customization and key selection requirements should already be met.

Note that it's possible though not required to provide the private key to 
the program as well. If you do not provide the private key, the certificate
as stored by the [store plugins](/win-acme/reference/plugins/store/) will
have limited use.

## Unattended 
`--target csr --csrfile C:\csr.txt [--pkfile C:\key.txt]`
